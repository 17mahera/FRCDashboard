# FRC Dashboard

FRC Dashboard is an extendable, web-browser-based dashboard for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC).

* Completely legal for competition as it works alongside standard DriverStation
* Touchscreen web browser interface provides richer control interface for secondary robot operator
  * While it's designed for touchscreens, can work without
* Lots of code commenting to help you easily understand code and add your robot's functions
* Inbuilt camera streaming system, gyroscope, encoder control, and example buttons

Technologies used:
* NetworkTables
* [pynetworktables2js](/robotpy/pynetworktables2js)

## Background

[FRC Team 1418 Vae Victis](/frc1418) used an earlier version of this code in practice and competition throughout 2014, 2015, and 2016.

## Setting up

* For the camera to work, you must change the source in `index.html` to the IP of your live camera feed. This may take some tweaking.
* It is recommended that you close the top panel of the FRC DriverStation to make room for a sized-down Chrome window.
